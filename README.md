# shortest-path-using-Networkx

1. Networkx used for finding the shortest path using djikstra.
2. Node file contains nodes with their x y coordinates
3. Edge file contains edges with their respective weights
4. Using djikstra and only showing the shortest path in a graph.
5. Visualization of this networkx is coupled with matplotlib.
6. Dynamic edges are also added and removed to showcase the modularity of the
   code.

   (Highlighted path in red is the shortest path taken)
